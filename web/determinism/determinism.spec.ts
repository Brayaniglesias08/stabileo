/**
 * The WASM engine gives bit-identical results in every runtime it ships to
 * (docs/verification/TRUSTED_BASE.md, "Determinism across runtimes"): a fixed set of solves
 * and certificates (cases.mjs) runs in this browser and in Node, and every output must be
 * the same string, floats compared by bit pattern. The Node run must also meet the
 * requirements of checks.mjs (the certified cases certify, field by field), so agreement is
 * never between two failed results. checks.test.mjs shows each check fails when it should.
 * Run with `npx playwright test -c determinism/playwright.config.ts` from web/.
