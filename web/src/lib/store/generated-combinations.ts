/**
 * Add generated combinations to the model, and file the service ones where the service checks

 *
 * A service combination is not a strength combination with small factors: it is what the
 * deflection check reads (`store/service-deflection.ts` takes the project's service
 * envelopes). So when service combinations are added they join a named envelope of purpose
 * `service`, and they are kept OUT of the active list the design reads.
 *
 * Strength combinations generated here are always in that list. With no list stated, "all"
 * already includes them. With one stated — by the user, or by an earlier generation that
 * added service combinations — the new ones are appended to it: a combination generated now
 * is one the user asked for. Before, a later strength-only generation left them out, and after
 * "replace existing" the pruned list was empty: the design read no combination at all.
 *
 * Run inside the caller's batch: one command, one undo step.
