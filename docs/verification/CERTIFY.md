# Certified linear static results

The Rust checker (`engine/src/certify/`) and the Lean proofs (`verify/`) implement and
prove this contract. Change both together.

## Setting

After eliminating restrained DOFs the solver solves `K u = f`, with `K` an n×n real
matrix (the assembled free-free stiffness, in f64), `f` the effective load vector.
The solver returns an approximation `ũ`. Let `u*` be the exact real solution.

`K` is *not* assumed bitwise symmetric (floating-point `Tᵀ k T` need not be).

## Theorem (coercivity error bound)

Let `S = (K + Kᵀ)/2`, `σ > 0`. If `S − σI` is positive semidefinite then for all x:

    σ‖x‖² ≤ xᵀSx = xᵀKx ≤ ‖x‖‖Kx‖     so     ‖Kx‖ ≥ σ‖x‖.

Hence K is invertible, `u*` exists and is unique, and with `r = f − Kũ`:

    ‖u* − ũ‖₂ ≤ ‖r‖₂ / σ.

## Certifying `S − σI ⪰ 0` (strictly: ≻ 0)

Run Cholesky on `M = S − σI` in interval arithmetic with outward rounding. Every
entry of the exact real `M` lies in its interval. Inclusion monotonicity means every
intermediate real quantity of exact Cholesky on `M` lies in the corresponding
interval. If every pivot interval (before the square root) has a strictly positive
lower bound, the exact real Cholesky of `M` has positive pivots, so `M` is positive
definite (Schur complement induction).

## Certifying `‖r‖₂`

Compute `r = f − Kũ` in interval arithmetic, then `ρ = ‖r‖₂` rounded up
(sum of squares of max |endpoint|, sqrt, all rounded up).

## Output

`bound = ρ / σ` rounded up, plus `rel = bound / ‖ũ‖₂` (rounded up). `σ` is chosen
heuristically (e.g. 0.9 × an estimate of λ_min(S)); soundness does not depend on how.
On failure (pivot not certified positive, non-finite value) the result is
`Uncertified { reason }`, never a wrong bound.

## Scalable certificate (Gram residual + Gershgorin)

For sparse/large systems the dense interval Cholesky is replaced by a check that is
linear in the number of nonzeros of `L` and `R`. The checker picks *any* real matrix
`L` — in practice the floating-point sparse Cholesky factor of `S − tI` for some shift
`t`, with rows permuted — and encloses the residual entrywise in intervals:

    R = S − L Lᵀ,   Rᵢⱼ ∈ IRᵢⱼ   for all i, j.

`R` is symmetric (both `S` and `L Lᵀ` are), and `xᵀ L Lᵀ x = ‖Lᵀx‖² ≥ 0` for every
real `L`. If for every row i

    μ ≤ IRᵢᵢ.lo − ∑_{j≠i} mag(IRᵢⱼ)        (interval Gershgorin row test)

then `μ‖x‖² ≤ xᵀRx` (from `|xᵢxⱼ| ≤ (xᵢ² + xⱼ²)/2` and symmetry of `R`), so

    xᵀKx = xᵀSx = xᵀ L Lᵀ x + xᵀRx ≥ μ‖x‖²,   i.e.  λ_min(S) ≥ μ.

If `μ > 0`, `σ := μ` certifies coercivity and the error bound above applies:
`‖u* − ũ‖₂ ≤ ρ / μ`. Soundness is independent of how `L` was computed: its fill-reducing
ordering, rounding errors, underflow, FMA, or even whether it is triangular only affect
the size of `R` (hence whether the test passes), never the validity of the bound. Only
the enclosure of `S − L Lᵀ` must be computed with outward rounding.

Lean: `Certify.certified_error_bound_gram` (`verify/Certify/Gram.lean`), built on
`quad_gram_nonneg`, `gershgorin_quad` and `coercive_of_gram`.

## Buckling load-factor enclosure

Linear buckling solves `K φ = λ N φ` with `N = −K_G`. The stability matrix
`A(λ) = K − λN` is affine in λ, and the structure is *stable* at λ when `A(λ) ≻ 0`
(`xᵀA(λ)x > 0` for all `x ≠ 0`). The critical load factor is where positive
definiteness is first lost:

    λ_cr = sup { λ ≥ 0 : A(λ') ≻ 0 for all λ' ∈ [0, λ] }.

* **Lower bound (convexity).** `xᵀA(λ)x = xᵀKx − λ xᵀNx` is affine in λ, so if
  `A(0) ≻ 0` and `A(λ̲) ≻ 0` then `A(λ) ≻ 0` on all of `[0, λ̲]`, hence `λ_cr ≥ λ̲`.
  Both endpoints are certified with the Gram residual + Gershgorin check above
  (applied to the interval-enclosed entries of `K − λN`, `μ > 0`).
* **Upper bound (Rayleigh quotient).** For the computed mode `φ ≠ 0`, if
  `φᵀKφ ∈ Inum`, `φᵀNφ ∈ Iden`, `Iden.lo > 0` and `λ̄ ≥ max(0, Inum.hi / Iden.lo)`
  (rounded up), then `φᵀA(λ̄)φ ≤ 0`, so `A(λ̄)` is not positive definite and `λ_cr ≤ λ̄`.

The enclosure `λ̲ ≤ λ_cr ≤ λ̄` is about the f64 `K` and `K_G` as assembled (with `K_G`
built from the computed linear axial forces), not about rounding-free versions of them.
Constraints are not supported.

Lean: `Certify.buckling_enclosure` (`verify/Certify/Buckling.lean`), built on
`stable_segment`, `not_stable_of_interval_rayleigh` and `stable_of_gram`; the
corollary `Certify.buckling_criticalFactor_mem` states `λ_cr ∈ [λ̲, λ̄]` for
`criticalFactor K N := sSup {λ | 0 ≤ λ ∧ ∀ λ' ∈ [0, λ], Stable K N λ'}`.

## Modal enclosures and completeness

Free vibration solves `K φ = λ M φ` (`λ = ω²`) with `K ≻ 0` and `M ⪰ 0` (possibly
singular). `engine/src/certify/modal.rs` certifies three things.

* **Single-mode enclosure.** With `C = K^{-1/2} M K^{-1/2}` (symmetric, eigenvalues
  `ν = 1/λ`) and `y = K^{1/2}φ`, the residual `C y − ν̂ y = K^{-1/2} s`,
  `s = Mφ − ν̂ Kφ`. For a symmetric matrix some eigenvalue `ν` satisfies
  `|ν − ν̂| ≤ ‖C y − ν̂ y‖₂ / ‖y‖₂` (Bauer–Fike for normal matrices), and
  `‖K^{-1/2}s‖/‖y‖ ≤ ‖s‖ / √(σ_K · φᵀKφ)` with `σ_K` a certified lower bound on `λ_min(K)`.
* **At most `j` eigenvalues `λ ≤ μ`.** Stated without eigenvalues (min-max form): every
  subspace `S` on which `xᵀ(K − μM)x ≤ 0` has `dim S ≤ j`. If `A = K − μM` is positive
  on a subspace `V` then `S ∩ V = 0`, so `dim S + dim V ≤ n`. Two certified choices
  of `V`: the coordinate subspace `{x | xᵢ = 0, i ∈ I}` (a principal submatrix of `A`
  with `|I| = j` rows/columns deleted is positive definite, `dim V = n − |I|`), or
  `V = ker Uᵀ` when `A + c U Uᵀ ≻ 0` for some `U ∈ ℝ^{n×j}` (Finsler; checked by the
  Gram residual + Gershgorin certificate).
* **At least `j` eigenvalues `λ < μ`.** Kahan's block residual theorem (Frobenius
  form) applied to `Y = K^{1/2}Φ`, `R = CY − Y diag(ν̂)`: if `‖Yz‖² ≥ g‖z‖²` (`g > 0`)
  and `‖R‖_F ≤ r`, at least `j` eigenvalues of `C` (with multiplicity) lie in
  `⋃ᵢ [ν̂ᵢ − ρ, ν̂ᵢ + ρ]`, `ρ = r/√g`; in particular at least `j` are `≥ min ν̂ − ρ`.
  The Rust takes `r² = Σᵢ ‖sᵢ‖²/σ_K` (column `i` of `R` is `K^{-1/2}sᵢ`, so this bounds
  `‖R‖_F²`, not just `‖R‖₂²`) and `g` a Gershgorin lower bound on `λ_min(ΦᵀKΦ) =
  σ_min(Y)²`, i.e. exactly the proved constant. Then `ν ≥ min ν̂ − ρ > 0` gives
  `λ = 1/ν ≤ 1/(min ν̂ − ρ) < μ`. Proof: in eigen-coordinates `R̂ₖᵢ = (λₖ − ν̂ᵢ)Ŷₖᵢ`; if
  fewer than `j` eigenvalues qualify, some `z ≠ 0` has `Yz` orthogonal to their
  eigenvectors, and Cauchy–Schwarz gives `g‖z‖² ≤ ‖Yz‖² < (r²/ρ²)‖z‖² = g‖z‖²`.

Lean (`verify/Certify/Modal.lean`), with `NonposSubspace A S := ∀ x ∈ S, xᵀAx ≤ 0`:

* `count_le_of_pos_on` / `count_le_of_pos_on'`: `A` positive on `V \ 0` ⇒ every
  nonpositive `S` has `dim S + dim V ≤ n` (`dim S ≤ n − dim V`).
* `finrank_deletedSubspace`: `dim {x | xᵢ = 0, i ∈ I} = n − |I|`;
  `count_le_of_deleted`: `A` positive there ⇒ `dim S ≤ |I|`. (Positivity of the
  principal submatrix is taken as a hypothesis; its Gram/Gershgorin certificate is not
  connected in Lean.)
* `count_le_of_finsler`: `A + c U Uᵀ ≻ 0` ⇒ `dim S ≤ j`; `count_le_of_finsler_gram`:
  the same from an interval Gram-residual certificate of `K − μM + c U Uᵀ` (any real `L`,
  Gershgorin bound `> 0`).
* `exists_eigenvalue_near`: for real symmetric `C`, `y ≠ 0` and any `ν`, some
  `e = hC.eigenvalues k` has `|e − ν| ≤ ‖Cy − νy‖₂ / ‖y‖₂` (via the spectral theorem).
  The change of variables to the pencil (`K^{±1/2}`, `σ_K`) is not formalized.
* `kahan_count_of_sep` (`verify/Certify/Kahan.lean`): `C` symmetric, `Y : n × m`,
  `∀ z, g‖z‖² ≤ ‖Yz‖²` (`g > 0`), `Σᵢⱼ (CY − Y diag ν)ᵢⱼ² ≤ r²`; if every eigenvalue
  `λₖ` with `¬P k` has `r² < g(λₖ − νⱼ)²` for all `j`, then `m ≤ #{k | P k}`.
  Corollaries (`r ≥ 0`, `ρ = r/√g`): `kahan_union_count`, `m ≤ #{k | ∃ j, |λₖ − νⱼ| ≤ ρ}`;
  `kahan_lower_count`, with `νmin ≤ νⱼ` for all `j`, `m ≤ #{k | νmin − ρ ≤ λₖ}` (the
  form the Rust uses). As above, the pencil change of variables (`C = K^{-1/2}MK^{-1/2}`,
  `‖K^{-1/2}s‖² ≤ ‖s‖²/σ_K`, `ΦᵀKΦ = YᵀY`, Gershgorin for `g`) is not formalized.

## Member force bounds

Local member end forces are affine in the element end displacements,
`f = k_local · T · u_e − fef`, so forces at the exact `u*` and the computed `ũ` differ
by `k_local T (u* − ũ)`. By Cauchy–Schwarz, component `i` satisfies

    |(k T (u* − ũ))ᵢ| ≤ ‖row_i(k)‖₂ · ‖T‖₂ · ‖u* − ũ‖₂,

with `‖T‖₂ ≤ 1 + 4ε` (rotation with rounded entries) and `‖u* − ũ‖₂` from the
displacement certificate (`engine/src/certify/forces.rs`). Rounding in the f64 force
evaluation itself is not included.

Lean (`verify/Certify/Forces.lean`): `abs_mulVec_sub_le` (`|(B(u − ũ))ᵢ| ≤
‖row_i B‖ ‖u − ũ‖`) and `force_bound`: if `‖row_i k‖ ≤ r`, `‖Tx‖ ≤ τ‖x‖` for all `x`
(`τ ≥ 0`) and `‖u − ũ‖ ≤ b`, then `|((kT)(u − ũ))ᵢ| ≤ r τ b`. The bound `‖T‖₂ ≤ 1 + 4ε`
is assumed, not proved.

## Rounding model

f64 ops round to nearest, so the exact result is within 0.5 ulp of the computed one.
Outward rounding = compute in round-to-nearest, then `next_down` the lower endpoint
and `next_up` the upper. Non-finite endpoints abort the certificate. In Lean this is
modelled by abstract `down, up : ℝ → ℝ` with `down x ≤ x ≤ up x`.

## Out of scope for v1

Mechanism certificates (exact rational null vectors), and proving the f64 implementation matches the Lean algorithm. (Large
models are covered by the Gram/Gershgorin certificate above; the dense interval
Cholesky is used only below the solver's sparse threshold.)
